# sign-up-form
This repository was created for a simple sign up form. 

This project has enabled me to learn how to create html forms, and the best practices when writing html forms. 

I also used css in styling the form during which I had to learn various techniques required in styling forms. 

I wrote some little javaScript as well. This is to ensure that the password and confirm password values match before allowing the user to submit the form.
